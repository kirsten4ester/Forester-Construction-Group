                        <h3>Your visions, realized</h3>
                        <p><em>We create properties, interiors and exterior spaces in which to live, entertain and thrive.</em></p>
                        <p>We don’t believe in anything other than awe-inspiring designs – and our services ensure that
                            our team of experts are with you every step of the way, whether you’re looking ahead to the
                            construction of an entirely new property built around you – or are seeking a renovation
                            overhaul. </p>
                        <p>Here you’ll find insight into the ways in which we work, and how we achieve the incredible
                            for the luxury, living spaces that our clients seek.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Renovation</h3>
                        <p><em>Your visions articulated – your space remodeled and renovated.</em></p>
                        <p>We’ve secured a hard-earned reputation for excellence as re-modelers – adept at projects that
                            range from a complete gut to mere additions. Yet beyond technical capabilities and
                            expertise, it is perhaps our client-centric approach that has ensured we’ve achieved such
                            standing.</p>
                        <p>In essence, this comes down to one thing: respect. We hold a great respect for the visions of
                            our clients – our role is to bring these visions to life, however these may be defined.
                            Couple this focus with an attentive service, and experts who simply listen at every stage of
                            the game, and the results speak for themselves. This is very much a collaborative effort
                            with the same focus held between us, and you – the client.</p>
                        <p>Quality of craftsmanship and exceptional service. It’s a simple combination yet an essential
                            blend for renovation projects that achieve all that you initially envisage.</p>

                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p><em>Every element of your interior, stylised to your exacting standards.</em></p>
                        <p>Commissioning an interior designers delivers in more ways than one. They ensure cohesiveness,
                            and a project that runs seamlessly; they can foster your ideas and mentor your visions;
                            ultimately they understand the demands and technicalities of your project, and may act as
                            the critical go-between for a same language that is spoken between every professional
                            involved in your project.</p>
                        <p>An interior designer endeavours to understand you – they learn about your preferences, your
                            style and all that it is that makes you, and your envisaged living space, unique. From the
                            start of the project they’ll work hand-in-hand with you – from ‘napkin’ sketches and idea
                            exploration – to the choosing of finishes, tiles, cabinets, colours and textures. All in all
                            an interior designer, alongside our design and build services, achieves a home that is
                            beautifully, individually yours, from the outside, in.</p>
                        <p>We’ll happily work with your retained interior designer, or we can highly recommend ones we
                            work with.</p>
